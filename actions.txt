teeth_landmarks: 8xnx80, load, reads and stores the landmarks

mean_centroids: list len 8, contains points stored as array (len 2)
	it is the centroid of the mean shape for each tooth, given the samples
		(mean of mean for each tooth)

around_origin: 8xnx80, stores the landmarks translated to have the centroid
	(mean of the points in zero)

mean_shape: 8x80, is the mean_shape of the teeth, computed from around_origin, 
	so it centred in the origin

scaled_shape_from_means: 8x80, mean_shape but scaled, with respect to mean_centroids[i]

around_origin_scaled: 8xnx80, around_origin but scaled to have norm = 1, with respect
	to get_tooth_centroid(tooth)
