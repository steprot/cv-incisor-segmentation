# cv-incisor-segmentation

The aim of this project was to write  an  algorithm  that  is  capable  of  segmenting  the upper and lower incisors in panoramic radiographs  using  a  model  based  approach. The choosen method is called Active Shape Models and it is described in Cootes at al. The implemented model can be broken down into sub-parts, namely: Building the model, Preprocessing the input images and Fitting the model on the new image.
